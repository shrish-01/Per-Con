        1. Stop arguing</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Arguing does not solve anything.

        According to a 2019 survey, 20% of the couples said that they argued with their partner over money issues
        atleast once a week.

        Such arguments can turn small relationship problems into large ones. To properly handle a difficult situation
        the first thing you must do is stop arguing. Rather than arguing, a couple has to handle the dilemma in a calm
        manner.

        But, the other side of the coin states that the couple that fights together stays together. Four times NYT
        bestselling author, Joseph Grenny says, “The success of a relationship is determined by the way in which
        sensitive issues are debated.”

        So you see, arguing is not all bad, if it is done in a proper manner. Instead, we can put it like this –
        communicate honestly and calmly.<br>

        2. Manage your emotions</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        One major relationship problem that crops up is when partners are unable to manage their emotions.

        A study on Emotion Regulation During Relationship Conflict Interactions says the negative emotions felt by one
        partner is directly connected with the negative emotions of the other partner.

        Negative responses during a conversation are likely to attract equally negative expressions from the other.

        So, prior to addressing the issue(s) directly, take some time to get emotions under control.

        Agreeing to stop arguing and actually doing it are two totally different things. Take some time to cool off and
        calm down

        Choosing to do so is very wise.

        You want to face the situation with a level head.

        3. Address the relationship problems</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Once emotions are under control, address the relationship problems with healthy communication, one at a time.
        This is how you deal with marriage issues.

        The only way to begin is by talking it out. Research says there are four different types of communication in
        relationships; each come with their fair share of benefits and costs. Now, it is up to the couples to understand
        which type will best work in resolving their relationship conflicts.

        Both sides have something to say and those things must be said. This is the time to be open with your partner
        and express how you really feel without being disrespectful or argumentative.

        style="text-align: left; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-style: normal;font-weight: 550;font-size: 2rem;">
        4. Come up with a resolution</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Come up with a resolution together

        After taking the time to talk, start working towards a common goal, i.e. resolution.

        At some point, someone has to say, “Let’s solve this so we can move forward”. If it is something silly, put
        things in perspective and let it go. As for more serious situations, find a solution that works best for both
        parties.

        Experts like psychologist and dating coach, Samantha Rodman says, “When you have a good night’s sleep, you can
        much more easily see your partner’s position and empathize, which means that making up is finally possible.”

        But, other researchers found that men are less competent to suppress a negative memory after they slept than
        they were before their sleep.

        Coming up with a proper solution before you hit the bed can save your relationship from going downhill. This
        will probably involve change so commit to taking action. This will help to resolve relationship problems and
        help your marriage grow and become stronger.

        Shift your perspective wisely
        After reaching a resolution, it is time to welcome positivity back into the relationship. Go out on a date,
        cuddle on the couch or enjoy an intimate evening in the bedroom.

        When you handle relationship problems in a healthy way, making up is wonderful.

        Shifting your perspective a little bit and handling difficulties wisely can play a crucial role in saving your
        marriage and drastically improving it too.</p><hr>

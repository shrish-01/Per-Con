        Recognize your jealousy.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        “When we name the jealousy, it loses its power, because we are no longer letting it shame us,” Hibbert said.
        Acknowledging that you’re jealous opens the door to learning

        Learn from your jealousy.</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Nobody gets jealous out of the blue for no reason at all! When you’re jealous, it could be because of a
        particular experience you’ve faced in the past. Perhaps you’re afraid that it could be happening all over again.
        Those buried feelings are like a ticking time bomb that’ll explode one day eventually. Hence why it’s best to
        settle it ASAP before all hell breaks loose

        Don’t jump into conclusions </h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Well, if you’re always saying things like ‘you’re always too friendly with girls’ or ‘you’re always looking at
        her’, then you’re accusing them of things you’re jealous of. When in actual fact, it’s not true – it’s just all
        in your head!
        When you’re not sure how to overcome jealousy, it’s best to stop yourself before you go off on your partner
        without getting the facts straight. Ask them about it before assuming things yourself right off the bat.

        Heal from your past trauma</h3><br>
    <div class="elementcontent">
        Be honest. Are you really healed from your past trauma and bad experiences in relationships?

        We all have them. No relationship is perfect after all, and it always comes with some sort of baggage.

        When learning how to stop being jealous, you have to heal yourself first. It’s also the best way to maintain a
        healthy relationship.

        Before you start getting all riled up, remember that all relationships are different.

            Seek advice from others </h3><br>
        <div class="elementcontent">
            How to stop being jealous for times when you just can’t help it? Talk it all out with people you trust.

            Okay, while you may prefer to keep your relationship problems to yourself, sometimes it backfires and makes
            you feel even worse.

            Yes, it’s good to talk about it to your partner, but oftentimes it may be better to talk it out with someone
            you trust to know if it’s just all in your head!
